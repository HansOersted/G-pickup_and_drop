Preparation: The robot lifts to the top.  
Step 1. Obtain object's position + velocity + transfer to reference.  
Step 2. [P controller loop] Track the object's position (x, y).  
Step 3. getting down to the object, assume that the time getting down is negligible for reference velocity (dx, dy).  
Step 4. Activate suction.  
Step 5. Pick the object to the top position.  
Step 6. Move the object to the drop position (x, y) while maintaining at the highest altitude.  
Step 7. Get down to the drop point (x, y, z).  
Step 8. Release the object and reset the robot.
